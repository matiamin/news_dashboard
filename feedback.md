| Back-end Technology             | No back-end present, or unable to persist data and return JSON __You have most of what you need on the backend but are rendering new views rather than serving json. Building an API which serves JSON is central to the project. Look into implementing this over break__                                                              |  |  |  |
| Front-end Technology            | | Basic front-end with few AJAX requests __You are making ajax requests directly from the front end to the bing api. Would really rather see your front end calling your api which makes 3rd party requests as necessary __                                                                                                                                                                |  |  |
| Code Quality                    |  | Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc) __Need to do a lot of tidying in the repo. There is currently a lot of commented out code, empty files, unused models, etc.__                                                          |  |  |
| Deployment and Functionality    |  |  | Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app.  __Some UI aspects you may want to add but didn't find any bugs that crashed the app __                                          |  |
| Planning / Process / Submission |  | App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application __Make sure to get the readme in good shape__ |  |  |
